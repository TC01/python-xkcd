xkcd v2.3.2 - A Python interface to xkcd.com
============================================

By Ben Rosser, released under MIT License (see LICENSE.txt)

This is a Python library for accessing and retrieving links to comics
from the xkcd webcomic by Randall Munroe. It is NOT endorsed or made by
him, it's an entirely independent project.

It makes use of the JSON interface to Randall's site to retrieve comic
data. One can create comic objects manually using Comic(number), or can
use the helper functions provided- getLatestComic(), getRandomComic(),
and getComic()- to do this. Once you have a Comic object, you can access
data from it using various provided methods.

Documentation is available `here <https://pythonhosted.org/xkcd/>`__.
